Easy:
1.	Write a Python program which accepts the user's first and last name and print them in reverse order with a space
between them.
"""

print("Anai", "Lopez")
namelist = ["Anai", "Lopez"]
namelist. reverse( )
print(namelist)

"""
2.	Write a Python program to find whether a given number (accept from the user) is even or odd, print out an 
appropriate message to the user.
